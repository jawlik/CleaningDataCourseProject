#Summary
The objective was to combine several wearable computing datasets from the UCI website (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
and calculate the mean for each activity-subject combination, returning this information in a tidy dataset.

The final output is found in the tidyDF.txt file
The R script developed to conduct this work is found in run_analysis.R
